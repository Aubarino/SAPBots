# S.A.P Bots | Adaptive Friends | The Garry's Mod Addon

#### This is a Garry's Mod Addon that adds "self aware player bots" to the game.
Originally competing with Zeta Players a couple years ago, it took a different direction to the rest,
and is now still mostly an AI experiment, with its own unique twists and focuses, to the Gmod Player Bots addon gimmick. While still adding a fun new overly convoluted nextbot that people can enjoy 'n attempt to replace their pathetic lack of friends with ingame :)

## Installation

You will need Aub Utility, the library addon I made, for shared functions 'n such. [Download the Aub Utility Addon here](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3327830058)

This Addon is developed in Clua / Glua, as any Garry's Mod Addon is,
for info on the functions of Garry's Mod, visit the [Facepunch gmod lua wiki here](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod), and Ctrl + F search any keyword, to find whatever function or variable you are looking for.
very useful resource.

You may also want to download a **Text Editor** such as **Visual Studio Code** or even something as simple as **Notepad++**

For source engine materials you will need **VTF Edit** that you can find [Here](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VTFEdit), If you wish to upload your own seperate addons for the sake of adding onto S.A.P Bots externally, as not to bloat the main addon, use [Crowbar](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Crowbar) to upload to the workshop and pack / unpack gmod addons, or some alternate.
For sound effects, use [AIMP](https://www.aimp.ru/?do=download) to convert audio to the correct bitrate .wav files, for higher quality use **44100Hz** otherwise use **22050Hz**, **16 or 8 bit are fine.**

To setup this repo on your system, simply clone this repo so the main folder contents are within a folder called ***"self_aware_players"*** in such a folder path 
***"steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons\self_aware_players"*** in full.
Relative to your steam directory, as where Garry's Mod is installed.

- **[1]** Contributions to the addon by others, are welcomed and will be credited depending on the amount of contributions made.
- **[2]** Development of and moving of functions to the **Aub Utility library** addon will be handled entirely by ___Aubarino___ separately to this project the majority of the time, future exceptions may occur.
- **[3]** All assets contained within the addon are owned by Aubarino for the sake of the addon's functionality, original ownership is irrelevant, otherwise it is fair usage / fan usage / parody. **All assets including code contributed to this addon** are owned by all majority contributors of such assets, **an example of this being -- if an asset is majorly made by Aubarino, it is by Aubarino.** simple enough to understand. Do not claim ownership of others work, and if you did not make the **majority** of other work, do not claim it as your own, as you do not have the grounds **legally** or morally. This is so you cannot steal or claim the work of others. **[1]** still applies over this.
