How to make a TTS Voise for S.A.P Bots to use ingame
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 

*THIS ONLY SUPPORTS ENGLISH TTS, AS MY PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS ENGLISH


This involves some linguistics O_O
but don't worry, it's literally as SIMPLE as recording some short seamless audio files with no
silences at either end, for each sound / "Phoneme"

I busted out some physical books, articles from the 80's,
and debugged the heck outa it, to make this shit work,
It ain't perfect, but it works, and is amazing.

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 

Info :

even if your Phonemes and etc sound garbage ingame, they may sound better with a future update of the mod,
as the tts system is being reworked refined over time.
the Phoneme Structure will persist and not change.

a "Phoneme" is a sound you make with your mouth when you try to speak,
words are built from them, and are sorta like segments coming together to form
a whole word / the separate sounds of a word

a "Grapheme" / "Graphemes" are common combinations of letters that trigger those sounds / "Phonemes"

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 

SETUP :

<YOUR MOD FOLDER>\sound\sapbots\tts\<YOUR TTS NAME>\phonem
replace "<YOUR MOD FOLDER>" with your mod name
replace "<YOUR TTS NAME>" with your tts name
you can add more then one TTS by adding more then one inside <YOUR MOD FOLDER>\sound\sapbots\tts\...

VERY HELPFUL NOTE :
if you put your mod's folder inside
\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons\
such as :
\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons\<YOUR MOD FOLDER>\...
then it will autorun with the game without needing to compile a mod 'n do all that bullshit in advance each time

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 

THE SOUND FILES :

All sound files need to be .wav format,
(44100 Hz) or whatever else works- probably just that though,
Mono channel - only one audio channel,
and some standard level of bit such as 16 bit.

you can make your audio ANY FORMAT YOU WANT in ANY WAY
if you want to use a program such as "AIMP" to bulk convert them to the correct format..
you can download "AIMP" at https://www.aimp.ru/
its what i've been using for bulk audio conversions,

. download it, open it, make it go big window or whatever, if it goes to tray- double click
. click the "AIMP" logo itself in the top left, it doesn't look like a button but it is.
. click on "Utilities" with the icon of a bag
. click "Audio Converter", it will open another window.
. click the green "+" button in the top right
. add your files
. in the bottom middle of the screen, in the format input, select "WAVE"
. to the right of that, select (44100 Hz / 16 Bit / Mono) 22050 also works
. if your files are in another location that ain't the correct folder, you can tick "Move output to:" and set it
. click the dropdown to the right of the blue setting sliders button in the top right to the right of the red "-"
. click "Delete source file after successful conversion"
. now click the tick box in the top left to select all sounds
. press the start button in the bottom right

now you should have sounds ready to work inside of Garry's Mod


Below is a summarized, simplistic, layman's terms examples,
of how these audiofiles are structured,
and basically what sounds you gotta record...

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
"The 44* Phonemes"
	- "wow 44? damn, that's a number i think O_O"
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

filename examples :
b.wav
d.wav
th_.wav
oo~.wav
a~(r.wav

filename = name + .wav

If you cannot figure out the sound of something enough, then just use a program like "Crowbar"
to rip apart this mod's files 'n listen to how the tts sounds in the default mod sound, for reference.

If this isn't helpful enough, here's a random page doc thing that may help :

WORD SETS / WORD PRESETS
(optional but usable if you want to recreate the personality of a voice better)

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 

make a "words" folder, as seen below.

<YOUR MOD FOLDER>\sound\sapbots\tts\<YOUR TTS NAME>\words
replace "<YOUR MOD FOLDER>" with your mod name
replace "<YOUR TTS NAME>" with your tts name
simular as before, but now we're in a "words" folder.


WARNING : word audio files cannot have the same name as a phoneme audio file or issues will occur
and stuff will be overridden and run like garbage, such as "i" or "a"


same audio format as before, same Hz, bit and etc.

make audio files and put them into the words folder,
the name of the file is what they will trigger / replace in the tts,
and the contents can be whatever, but is recommended to be the word they are named.
an example of a very rare exception is :
	The word "map" being replaced with the word "world" in the Heavy tf2 text to speech
	that comes with the mod.

it is recommended that you use these word sets / word presets-
for commonly used words, such as "the", "and", "this", "want", "much", "like", "hate", "kill", "you"... and whatever others,
if you even use these at all, again- they are optional, and used situationally and merged with other sounds

it is NOT recommended to have 50 thousand damn words in here, bloating the file size.
keep your mods not fucking 100mb please, please under like 20mb max,
also the more you add the more bullshit the game needs to process, these are not a good approach compared to phonemes, but are a quality control thing mostly,
for things like lisps and exact perfect saying of words

DEATH SOUNDS
(optional but good if you want your tts voice to make noises on death, or premade lines)

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 

make a "deaths" folder, as seen below.

<YOUR MOD FOLDER>\sound\sapbots\tts\<YOUR TTS NAME>\deaths
replace "<YOUR MOD FOLDER>" with your mod name
replace "<YOUR TTS NAME>" with your tts name
simular as before, but now we're in a "deaths" folder.


same audio format as before, same Hz, bit and etc.

make audio files and put them into the deaths folder,
the names do not matter and don't have any numbering or order, they can be whatever name you want.

they can be longer entire bits of premade dialog or audio,
or simple death grunts or etc, its a wide range of possibilities..

REMEMBER : THEY HAVE DIED, THIS PLAYS ON THEIR DEATH, try not to make a corpse talk too much lol

heck you could even just put meme sound effects if your tts is a joke :)
or screaming even, loud horrible screaming, lots and lots of screaming :)

. include "[SapbotTTS]" or whatever kind of S.A.P Bot thing you've made, such as "[SapbotTTS]", with the [] but without the "" accordingly,
so people can find your mod on-topic easier
. write your description - - -
do header text like this :
[h1]Bla Bla Bla[/h1]
do bold text like this :
[b]Bla Bla BLa[/b]
you can put links,
do images like this :

. wait unpatiently... O_O
. do any last-minute edits to your now fully loaded and uploaded workshop page,
such as editting the change note if you want via the change notes tab, editting the visibility again to be public,
uploading more images to your workshop page via steam or a video.
. add to the "required items" of the mod, the S.A.P Bot mod itself,
so your mod doesn't get flagged for not working by some random admin 'n bad shit happens O_O
. link it to your friends, and the rest of us :)
